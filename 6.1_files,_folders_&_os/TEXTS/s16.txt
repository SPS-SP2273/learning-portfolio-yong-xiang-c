When dealing with computers, you will often encounter the term ‘path’. The path is simply a way to specify a location on your computer. It is like an address, and if you follow the path, it will take you to your file or folder. Like specifying location, you can specify your path absolutely or relatively. So, for example, I can specify that SPS is located on level 3 of block S16. However, if I am already on Level 5 of S16, I can say, go two floors down. The former is an absolute path, and the latter is relative. I have always found it easier to use relative paths, especially if I later want to move my folders about.
